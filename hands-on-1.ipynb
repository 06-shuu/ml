    "PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique. It is commonly used to reduce the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining most of the information present in the original data. Performing PCA can sometimes lower accuracy because it involves reducing the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto a lower-dimensional subspace. This reduction in dimensionality can result in some loss of information, which may affect the performance of certain algorithms that rely heavily on the original feature space.\n",

This is because the fit_transform() method of PCA is used on the training set to learn the transformation based on its statistical properties. Applying transform() directly to the testing set would not utilize the information learned from the training set and could lead to inconsistent transformations, making it difficult to compare and interpret the results.</p>\n"
